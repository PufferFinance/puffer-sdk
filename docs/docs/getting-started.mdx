# Getting Started

Get up and running with the Puffer SDK in just a few steps.

## Overview

Puffer SDK is a TypeScript library for interacting with Puffer smart contracts. It provides an API and helper functions to execute smart contracts in the browser.

The SDK is focused on providing a smooth developer experience.

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup the Puffer Client

`PufferClient` is the main entry point of the SDK and contains the core functionality provided by the SDK.

```ts
import {
  PufferClientHelpers,
  PufferClient,
  Chain,
} from '@pufferfinance/puffer-sdk';

// highlight-start
const walletClient = PufferClientHelpers.createWalletClient({
  chain: Chain.Holesky,
  provider: window.ethereum,
});
const pufferClient = new PufferClient(Chain.Holesky, walletClient);
// highlight-end
```

### 2. Connect to the Wallet

A wallet can be connected to by requesting its address from the SDK.

```ts
const [walletAddress] = await pufferClient.requestAddresses();
```

### 3. Interact with the Contract

Mint pufETH to your `walletAddress` or set a target recipient:

```ts
const { transact, estimate } = pufferClient.vault.depositETH(walletAddress);

// Returns gas estimate of the transaction.
const gasEstimate = await estimate();
// Execute the transaction for depositing ETH.
const txHash = await transact(BigInt(1e18));
```
