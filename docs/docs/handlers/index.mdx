# Contract Handlers

The SDK uses handlers for each Puffer contract to interact with it. Each handler exposes a set of methods that calls the related functions of the contract. It's also possible to get the original contract from the handler which can then be used to call any low-level contract function directly.

## Existing Handlers

We currently have the following handlers.

- [ERC20PermitHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/erc20-permit-handler.md)\
  For interacting with the `ERC20Permit` contract for any supported token.
- [PufLockerHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/puf-locker-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `PufLocker` contract.
- [PufferDepositorHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/puffer-depositor-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `PufferDepositor` contract.
- [PufferL2DepositorHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/puffer-l2-depositor-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `PufferL2Depositor` contract.
- [PufferVaultHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/puffer-vault-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `PufferVault` contract.
- [L1RewardManagerHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/l1-reward-manager-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `L1RewardManager` contract.
- [L2RewardManagerHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/l2-reward-manager-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `L2RewardManager` contract.
- [L2RewardManagerHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/l2-reward-manager-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Puffer's `L2RewardManager` contract.
- [NucleusBoringVaultHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/nucleus-boring-vault-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Nucleus's `BoringVault` contract.
- [NucleusTellerHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/nucleus-teller-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Nucleus's `Teller` contract.
- [NucleusAccountantHandler](../api/contracts/handlers/nucleus-accountant-handler.md)\
  For interacting with Nucleus's `Accountant` contract.

More details about each handler can be found in their respective API documentation.

## Using Handlers

There are two ways to use handlers.

### 1. Using the PufferClient

The `PufferClient` is the entry point for the SDK and contains all handlers. See [PufferClient#Properties](../api/api/puffer-client.md#properties) for the full list of contract handlers `PufferClient` has.

```ts
import {
  PufferClientHelpers,
  PufferClient,
  Chain,
} from '@pufferfinance/puffer-sdk';

const walletClient = PufferClientHelpers.createWalletClient({
  chain: Chain.Holesky,
  provider: window.ethereum,
});

// highlight-start
// Use the `PufferClient` to interact with `PufferVaultHandler`.
const pufferClient = new PufferClient(Chain.Holesky, walletClient);
const { transact } = pufferClient.vault.depositETH('0x123...');
const txHash = await transact(BigInt(1e18));
// highlight-end
```

### 2. Using the Handler Directly

This is the optimal way to use handlers since this will only import code and ABI of the handler being used which will improve tree-shaking and reduce bundle size depending on the bundler used. The downside of this is that the code will be more verbose.

```ts
// highlight-start
// Import the modules directly from their respective files.
import { Chain } from '@pufferfinance/puffer-sdk/dist/chains/constants';
import { PufferClientHelpers } from '@pufferfinance/puffer-sdk/dist/api/puffer-client-helpers';
import { PufferVaultHandler } from '@pufferfinance/puffer-sdk/handlers/puffer-vault-handler';
// highlight-end

const walletClient = PufferClientHelpers.createWalletClient({
  chain: Chain.Holesky,
  provider: window.ethereum,
});
const publicClient = PufferClientHelpers.createPublicClient({
  chain: Chain.Holesky,
  provider: window.ethereum,
});

// highlight-start
const pufferVaultHandler = new PufferVaultHandler(
  Chain.Holesky,
  walletClient,
  publicClient,
);
const { transact } = pufferVaultHandler.depositETH('0x123...');
const txHash = await transact(BigInt(1e18));
// highlight-end
```
